# Deep Learning with TensorFlow: Learning Journey

Welcome to my deep learning journey with TensorFlow! This repository documents my progress as I explore the fundamentals of deep learning using TensorFlow. Below are some of the exercises and concepts Iâ€™ve learned so far.

## ðŸ“š What I've Learned So Far

### 00. TensorFlow Fundamentals Exercises

1. **Create Basic Tensors:**

   - Created a **vector**, **scalar**, **matrix**, and **tensor** using `tf.constant()`.

2. **Tensor Properties:**

   - Found the **shape**, **rank**, and **size** of the tensors created in step 1.

3. **Random Tensors:**

   - Created two tensors containing **random values between 0 and 1** with the shape `[5, 300]`.

4. **Matrix Multiplication:**

   - Multiplied the two tensors created in step 3 using **matrix multiplication**.

5. **Dot Product:**

   - Multiplied the two tensors created in step 3 using **dot product**.

6. **Create a Tensor with Random Values:**

   - Created a tensor with **random values between 0 and 1** with the shape `[224, 224, 3]`.

7. **Find Min and Max Values:**

   - Found the **minimum** and **maximum** values of the tensor created in step 6 along the first axis.

8. **Squeeze a Tensor:**

   - Created a tensor with random values of shape `[1, 224, 224, 3]` and then used the `squeeze` operation to change the shape to `[224, 224, 3]`.

9. **Find the Maximum Value Index:**

   - Created a tensor with shape `[10]` using my own choice of values, and then found the **index with the maximum value**.

10. **One-Hot Encoding:**
    - One-hot encoded the tensor created in step 9.
